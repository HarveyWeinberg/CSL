# CSL Masters Project
ITensor C++ code for iDMRG for a CSL with J1-J2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with chiral perturbation on a 2D cylindrical geometry. 

The code is divided into two parts: 

(a) construction of the MPO using infinite matrix product operators for the iDMRG ITensor code. 

(b) analysis code to extract correlation functions and the momentum resolved entanglement entropy from considering the transfer matrix in the right orthogonal gauge. Subsequent analysis to be done in Python (not included in GitHub repository). 

Additional ideas: allow for more diverse triangle setups with more readable code.
